Prerequisite:

	Compile and install Herodotos

	./configure && make world && sudo make install

Instructions:

 1) Setup the environment

      * Copy default make files from herodotos/scripts
        and define your working directory

          make -f Makefile.local

      * Check in demo.hc that 'projects' attribute is
        properly set up.

 2) Initialize the environment

          make init

 3) Compute raw data

          make -j2

 4) Compute changeset

      * Edit Makefile.patchset
         but it is not needed for the demo

      * Execute computation

          make -f Makefile.patchset

  5) Correlate bug reports

          make correl (build a initial set)
          make correl (use the initial set)

  6) Manually edit the remaining correlation

          $EDITOR results/test/error.correl.org

       Emacs with the Org mode is recommended.
       Org mode view-link add-on will transform your
       emacs in a wizard to handle Coccinelle reports.

       See ./scripts/org-view-link.el

  7) Use the new complementary correlation information

          make correl

  8) Check the result

          make count

  9) Look for false positive

          cp results/test/error.edit.org results/test/error.new.org

       * Edit the new copy and annotate the reported TODO
         with either BUG or FP

 10) Generate graphs (or website)

          make graph/web


 11) Edit and personalize demo.hc

       * Iterate on steps 10 and 11.
       * Available graph types:
          - avgage
          - avglifespan
          - birth
          - birthfile
          - cumulsum
          - death
          - deathfile
          - density
          - eldest
          - eldestdeath
          - lifeexpect
          - netincrease
          - size
          - sizepct
          - sum
