 ** PREREQUISITE **

 See the README file

 ** INSTALL **

	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	sudo make install

 This will build and install a O'Caml bytecode version
 of the Herodotos tool suite.

 To build the native version replace "make" by "make opt".
 If you want both, you may use "make world".
